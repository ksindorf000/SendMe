    <h2><strong>The Motivation</strong></h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
        <strong>The Global Health Initiative from the World Health Organization</strong>
            <p>
                WHO's Global School Health Initiative, launched in 1995, seeks to mobilise and
                strengthen health promotion and education activities at the local, national,
                regional and global levels. The Initiative is designed to improve the health of
                students, school personnel, families and other members of the community through schools.
            </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Research to improve school health programmes:
                Evaluation research and expert opinion is analyzed and consolidated to describe the
                nature and effectiveness of school health programmes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Building capacity to advocate for improved school health programmes:
                technical documents are generated that consolidate research and expert opinion about
                the nature, scope and effectiveness of school health programmes.Each advocacy document
                makes a strong case for addressing an important health problem, identifies components
                of a comprehensive school health programme, and provides guidance in integrating the
                issue into the components.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strengthening national capacities:
                collaboration between health and education agencies is fostered and countries are
                helped to develop strategies and programmes to improve health through schools.
                Pilot projects implemented by the GSHI and partners include Helminth Interventions
                with China in 1996, HIV/STI Prevention in China in 1997, and Health-Promoting Schools/Health
                Insurance in Vietnam in 1998.

    <h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
        Medical students need to be able to raise and track funds for their
        overseas practicums. Faculty and staff need to be able to track students'
        fund-raising progress. However, since there is no standard system for
        students to use, faculty and staff end up having to keep up with multiple
        applications depending on each student's tracking method of choice.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>
    <hr />    
    
    <p>
        Send Me! is a secure, user-friendly application that will allow students to
        create profiles to which donors can navigate in order to donate funds to the
        student's trip. The student's profile will display their active trip and the
        progress they have made towards their monetary goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students will have to verify their school email address and so will be affiliated
        with their school in the application. Each school will have a dedicated page where
        the progress of their students' fund-raising is displayed. This will make it easy
        for faculty and staff to keep up with all of their students in one place.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an added bonus,this will allow Alumni of the school who wish to donate to
        current students the opportunity to do so without having to reach out to the
        school's administration to find out where to send funds.
